# 🧬 Bioinformatics & Computational Science Resources

Welcome to my open-source collection of bioinformatics, computational biology, and interdisciplinary science repositories.

This GitHub profile hosts **over 240 repositories** developed between **2010 and 2025**, primarily as part of my teaching, research, and self-study in bioinformatics, physics, and information technologies. The materials include code examples, lecture notes, software tutorials, data analysis pipelines, and educational projects — many of which were used in university courses such as *Bioinformatics*, *Health Information Systems*, and *Scientific Programming*.

## 📚 Nature of the Content

Many of these repositories are **educational in nature** and reflect the state of bioinformatics tools, workflows, and teaching methods during the **2010–2018 period**. While some projects are outdated or no longer actively maintained, they serve as:

- ✅ **Historical records** of how bioinformatics was taught and practiced in that era  
- ✅ **Foundational learning resources** for understanding core concepts (e.g., BLAST, sequence alignment, Perl/Python scripting, genome browsers)  
- ✅ **Inspiration for new educators** developing curriculum materials  
- ✅ **Starting points** for students exploring computational biology

Some repositories have been used in published textbooks and academic courses in Turkey and beyond.

## 🔍 How to Use This Collection

- 🔎 **For learners**: Start with repositories labeled `tutorial`, `intro`, or `educational`. Focus on concepts rather than tools — many ideas (e.g., central dogma, sequence analysis, statistical testing) remain timeless.
- ⚙️ **For educators**: Feel free to adapt, reuse, or translate any material (under the applicable license).
- 🛠️ **For developers**: Some tools use older technologies (e.g., Perl, BioPerl, standalone GUIs), but the logic and algorithms can be modernized using current frameworks (Python, Nextflow, Docker, etc.).

## 📦 Notable Repositories

| Repo | Description |
|------|-----------|
| [`bioperl-lectures`]() | Introduction to BioPerl with practical examples (2013) |
| [`bioinformatics-tutorials`]() | Step-by-step guides on BLAST, sequence formats, and file parsing |
| [`python-for-bioinformatics`]() | Early Python scripts for biological data processing |
| [`genome-visualization`]() | Tools and examples for visualizing genomic data (Artemis, ACT, DNAPlotter) |
| [`r-for-biostatistics`]() | R scripts for statistical analysis in life sciences |

> 🔔 **Note**: URLs, software versions, and dependencies may be outdated. Always verify compatibility with current systems.

## 📜 License & Reuse

## 📬 Contact & Contributions

I no longer actively maintain most of these repositories, but I appreciate feedback, corrections, and forks.

If you find these resources helpful, I’d love to hear from you.  
For major updates or modernizations, feel free to create a **fork** or **pull request** — your work may inspire others.

## 📚 **Archival Notice: Bioinformatics Book Series**

The following books were authored between 2015 and 2019 as part of my teaching and educational efforts in bioinformatics. These publications reflect the state of bioinformatics tools, workflows, and pedagogical approaches **during that period**.

> ⚠️ **Important**: All books listed below are now considered **archival materials**.  
> They are **no longer updated or maintained** and should be used for **historical, educational, or reference purposes only**.

While the **core biological and computational concepts** (e.g., sequence analysis, BLAST, central dogma, basic scripting) remain relevant, **specific software tools, versions, interfaces, and dependencies** described in these books may be **outdated or obsolete**.

We encourage learners and educators to consult **current textbooks, peer-reviewed resources, and up-to-date online platforms** (e.g., Bioconductor, Galaxy, NCBI, EMBL-EBI, Coursera, Rosalind) for modern bioinformatics practices.
