# üß¨ Bioinformatics & Computational Science Resources

Welcome to my open-source collection of bioinformatics, computational biology, and interdisciplinary science repositories.

This GitHub profile hosts **over 240 repositories** developed between **2010 and 2025**, primarily as part of my teaching, research, and self-study in bioinformatics, physics, and information technologies. The materials include code examples, lecture notes, software tutorials, data analysis pipelines, and educational projects ‚Äî many of which were used in university courses such as *Bioinformatics*, *Health Information Systems*, and *Scientific Programming*.

## üìö Nature of the Content

Many of these repositories are **educational in nature** and reflect the state of bioinformatics tools, workflows, and teaching methods during the **2010‚Äì2018 period**. While some projects are outdated or no longer actively maintained, they serve as:

- ‚úÖ **Historical records** of how bioinformatics was taught and practiced in that era  
- ‚úÖ **Foundational learning resources** for understanding core concepts (e.g., BLAST, sequence alignment, Perl/Python scripting, genome browsers)  
- ‚úÖ **Inspiration for new educators** developing curriculum materials  
- ‚úÖ **Starting points** for students exploring computational biology

Some repositories have been used in published textbooks and academic courses in Turkey and beyond.

## üîç How to Use This Collection

- üîé **For learners**: Start with repositories labeled `tutorial`, `intro`, or `educational`. Focus on concepts rather than tools ‚Äî many ideas (e.g., central dogma, sequence analysis, statistical testing) remain timeless.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **For educators**: Feel free to adapt, reuse, or translate any material (under the applicable license).
- üõ†Ô∏è **For developers**: Some tools use older technologies (e.g., Perl, BioPerl, standalone GUIs), but the logic and algorithms can be modernized using current frameworks (Python, Nextflow, Docker, etc.).

# Core Concepts

## Science  
Science is the art of constructing models. These models are built upon axioms, postulates, and a priori assumptions. When supported by experimental evidence, such models are retained and refined. As technology advances, these models are extended and improved. In some cases, evolving technologies may challenge or even transform our scientific models. Science has no final endpoint; it continually renews itself through new perspectives. Like a bride wearing multiple veils, each time we lift a veil, we encounter a new face of reality. Thus, every scientist is both an artist and a master craftsman.  
‚Äî *Mehmet Ke√ßeci, 18.05.2010* [132, 174, 240, 242]

## Cybernetics  
Cybernetics is an applied scientific discipline that studies how humans, through interaction with their environment, perceive reality. It focuses on communication, control, and feedback mechanisms in complex systems, forming a bridge between human cognition and the surrounding world.  
‚Äî *Mehmet Ke√ßeci, 15.01.2014* [132, 174, 240, 242]

## Cybermedicine  
Cybermedicine is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, internet and network technologies, wired and wireless communications, mechanics, electronics, robotics, and data processing software. It applies these technologies‚Äîeither in whole or in part‚Äîto the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of humans and other living organisms.  
‚Äî *Mehmet Ke√ßeci, 15.01.2014* [132, 174, 240, 242]

## Bioinformatics (Biyoinformatik, Bioinformatyka)  
Bioinformatics is a scientific discipline that enables us to better understand the nature and reality of biological systems. It involves the collection, processing, interpretation, and analysis of biological data within virtual (in silico), experimental (in vitro), and living (in vivo) environments. By identifying problems and developing solutions, bioinformatics helps make sense of complex biological information.  
‚Äî *Mehmet Ke√ßeci, 21.03.2015* [132, 240, 242]

## In Silico, In Vitro, In Vivo  
*In silico* (in silicon/computationally), *in vitro* (in glass/ex vivo), and *in vivo* (in life/within living organisms) refer to different environments for solving bioscientific problems.  
Bioinformatics is a branch of computer science focused on biological data, primarily at the molecular level. Advances in biology have generated vast amounts of data on genes, genomes, proteins, and complex biological interactions. The field encompasses databases, data visualization, and algorithmic analysis tools to interpret this information.

## Infonomics  
Infonomics is a discipline that deals with the acquisition, valuation, and sustainable economic utilization of information or knowledge‚Äîwhether already available or yet to be obtained. It aims to format information into economic value not previously present in traditional economies, ensuring continuity and sustainability in the knowledge society.  
‚Äî *Mehmet Ke√ßeci, 07.09.2013* [132, 174, 186, 240, 242]

## Criminal Informatics  
Criminal Informatics is an interdisciplinary field that involves the collection, processing, and interpretation of criminal-related data‚Äîincluding bioscientific, chemical, physical, cybernetic, IT, and human factors (psychological, sociological). It focuses on identifying problems, analyzing patterns, understanding criminal behavior, and generating solutions in real-life (in vivo) and virtual (in silico, in vitro) environments. The goal is to enhance individual, social, and public security by uncovering truths, presenting evidence, and enabling effective tracking and prevention.  
‚Äî *Mehmet Ke√ßeci, Biyoenformatik I & Abstract Thought & Analytic Thinking Quotes & Words: Kelimeler, 17.06.2015* [131, 312, 313, 314]

## Data Science  
Data Science is the discipline of transforming raw data‚Äîranging from small datasets to big data‚Äîinto meaningful information using tools from information technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), mathematics, statistics, quantum statistics, and programming. It operates at analytical and logical levels, employing algorithms and software to extract insights and generate actionable outputs. Practitioners in this field are known as *Data Scientists*.  
‚Äî *Mehmet Ke√ßeci, 03.08.2017* [131, 313, 314]

## System Engineer  
A System Engineer is someone who can perceive a phenomenon‚Äîor its components‚Äîas a system, possesses the intellectual infrastructure to reorganize events based on this systemic understanding, and can transform them into desired forms of knowledge, science, or art.  
‚Äî *Mehmet Ke√ßeci, 04.07.2017* [131]

## System Boundary  
The system boundary is defined by the sum of past and present perceptions. It extends only as far as our imagination and capacity to act upon it. In other words, the boundary of a system is determined by what we can conceive and influence.  
‚Äî *Mehmet Ke√ßeci, 04.07.2017* [131]

## Artificial Intelligence (AI, A.I.)  
Artificial Intelligence refers to simulated intelligence resembling human cognition. It involves electronic, circuit-based, chemical, biological, or physical systems that use intelligent algorithms to evaluate incoming information or raw data from external sources. These systems generate new information based on their evaluations, use it in chain reactions, and continuously develop and refine their outputs. Such systems can be embedded in devices or designed to emulate a Humanoid/Smart (Cultivated & Cognitive) Brain (HumIn).  
‚Äî *Mehmet Ke√ßeci, 03.09.2017* [131]

## On the Diseases of Our Age  
One of the defining health challenges of our time is the increasing prevalence of cryptogenic diseases‚Äîconditions with unknown causes.  
‚Äî *Mehmet Ke√ßeci, 17.05.2016* [521]
