# 🧬 Bioinformatics & Computational Science Resources

Welcome to my open-source collection of bioinformatics, computational biology, and interdisciplinary science repositories.

This GitHub profile hosts **over 140 repositories** developed between **2010 and 2024**, primarily as part of my teaching, research, and self-study in bioinformatics, physics, and information technologies. The materials include code examples, lecture notes, software tutorials, data analysis pipelines, and educational projects — many of which were used in university courses such as *Bioinformatics*, *Health Information Systems*, and *Scientific Programming*.

## 📚 Nature of the Content

Many of these repositories are **educational in nature** and reflect the state of bioinformatics tools, workflows, and teaching methods during the **2010–2018 period**. While some projects are outdated or no longer actively maintained, they serve as:

- ✅ **Historical records** of how bioinformatics was taught and practiced in that era  
- ✅ **Foundational learning resources** for understanding core concepts (e.g., BLAST, sequence alignment, Perl/Python scripting, genome browsers)  
- ✅ **Inspiration for new educators** developing curriculum materials  
- ✅ **Starting points** for students exploring computational biology

Some repositories have been used in published textbooks and academic courses in Turkey and beyond.

## 🔍 How to Use This Collection

- 🔎 **For learners**: Start with repositories labeled `tutorial`, `intro`, or `educational`. Focus on concepts rather than tools — many ideas (e.g., central dogma, sequence analysis, statistical testing) remain timeless.
- ⚙️ **For educators**: Feel free to adapt, reuse, or translate any material (under the applicable license).
- 🛠️ **For developers**: Some tools use older technologies (e.g., Perl, BioPerl, standalone GUIs), but the logic and algorithms can be modernized using current frameworks (Python, Nextflow, Docker, etc.).

## 📦 Notable Repositories

| Repo | Description |
|------|-----------|
| [`bioperl-lectures`]() | Introduction to BioPerl with practical examples (2013) |
